# PDF_Study_Agent Project Overview

## Project Objective

Create a versatile agent capable of summarizing PDF documents and generating interactive quizzes. This agent will leverage AI processing for educational purposes, providing students with concise study material and self-assessment quizzes.

## 1. Setup & Context Preservation (Essential)

**Documentation File:**
Immediately create or overwrite a file named `GEMINI.md` in the root directory of your project.

**Context Storage:**
The `GEMINI.md` file will serve as a persistent project reference. Include the full project description, specifications, and instructions here so the agent can access it at any time for context.

## 2. Technology Stack & Environment

* **Model/Server:** Gemini CLI with a capable model such as `gemini-2.5-pro`.
* **MCP Server Context:** Use `Context7` as the official MCP server context.
* **Agent SDK:** OpenAI Agents SDK (Python implementation) for orchestrating agent behavior, tools, and workflows.
* **Frontend:** Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive web interface.
* **PDF Processing:** PyPDF (or `pypdf`) for extracting text from PDF files reliably.

## 3. Agent Functionality – PDF Summarizer

**Input:**
Users can upload a single PDF via a Streamlit file uploader (`st.file_uploader`).

**Text Extraction:**

* Use PyPDF to extract text from all pages of the uploaded PDF.
* Handle multi-page documents and typical extraction challenges gracefully.

**Processing:**

* Send the extracted text to the Gemini model for analysis.
* The model should produce a clear, concise, and meaningful summary capturing all key concepts and important details.

**Output/Display:**

* Show the summary prominently in Streamlit.
* Students can choose different display styles (cards, containers, expanders) for a visually appealing presentation.

## 4. Agent Functionality – Quiz Generator

**Trigger:**
Enable a "Create Quiz" button only after the summary is successfully generated.

**Input Source:**
Use the **original extracted text** (not the summary) to generate quiz questions.

**Question Generation:**

* Ask the Gemini model to create at least 10 high-quality **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**, each with 4 options (A, B, C, D) and a hidden correct answer.
* Include a variety of other question types (True/False, Fill-in-the-Blank) to reach a total of 15–20 questions.

**Output/Display:**

* Present all questions in a clean, interactive format on Streamlit.
* Include a “Check Answers” button for users to verify their responses.


## 5. Technical & Code Guidelines

* Follow **OpenAI Agents SDK** best practices for Python.
* Include a **requirements.txt** file to manage dependencies.
* Handle errors gracefully (e.g., non-PDF uploads or extraction failures) and provide informative user feedback.
* The application should run with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Next Steps

Develop the **PDF_Study_Agent** project with the following components:

1. `app.py` – Streamlit frontend and user interaction logic.
2. Agent logic using OpenAI Agents SDK for PDF summarization and quiz generation.
3. PDF extraction code using PyPDF.
4. Complete `GEMINI.md` file populated with this project context.

This setup ensures a robust, interactive, and student-friendly learning assistant that combines AI-powered summarization with self-assessment quizzes.
